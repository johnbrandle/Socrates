            If you do not adhere to the terms set forth in this License for the use of the Licensed Work, 
            you are required to cease any use of the Licensed Work immediately.

            All copies of the original and modified Licensed Work, and derivative works of the Licensed Work, are subject to this 
            License. This License applies separately for each version of the Licensed Work and the Change Date may vary for each 
            version of the Licensed Work released by Licensor.

            You must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy of the Licensed Work. If you receive the 
            Licensed Work in original or modified form from a third party, the terms and conditions set forth in this License apply 
            to your use of that work.

            Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this License will automatically terminate your rights under this License

        Covenants of Licensor:
            
            In consideration of the right to use this License’s text and the “Business Source License” name and trademark, Licensor 
            covenants to MariaDB, and to all other recipients of the licensed work to be provided by Licensor:

            To specify as the Change License the GPL Version 2.0 or any later version, or a license that is compatible with GPL Version 2.0 
            or a later version, where “compatible” means that software provided under the Change License can be included in a program with 
            software provided under GPL Version 2.0 or a later version. Licensor may specify additional Change Licenses without limitation.
            To either: (a) specify an additional grant of rights to use that does not impose any additional restriction on the right granted 
            in this License, as the Additional Use Grant; or (b) insert the text “None” to specify a Change Date. Not to modify this License 
            in any other way.

        Note:
        
            The Business Source License (this document, or the “License”) is not an Open Source license. However, the Licensed Work will 
            eventually be made available under an Open Source License, as stated in this License.
